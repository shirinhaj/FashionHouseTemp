## Explaining the Unity project

This unity project includes some example assets such as models, materials, textures, videos, and scripts placed in the related folders. 

In the scenes folder of the project, double click on the name of a scene named "Virtual Museum" to open it. This example scene aimed to provide a guideline for students' projects providing a virtual museum experience. At the start, the user finds himself/herself in front of a door. By tapping on the screen of the smartphone (or pressing the button of the cardboard), s/he can move in the direction of his/her look. Passing a corridor, s/he will reach the entering of two rooms with texts and images overlayed on their surrounding walls. The left room provides two interaction experiences through having eye gaze on the available buttons: a video player and an image viewer. In the right room, user can rotate 3D models of clothes by having her/his gaze on top of the rotate buttons.

## Links to the helpful tutorials
During the projects, it would be needed to create the experience in a virtual building with realistic appearance.
The 3D model of building could be provided whether by downloading the free 3D versions or created by Probuilder tool in Unity. Some free 3D models dowloaded from asset store are placed inside this folder: Models -> Buildings -> Downloaded Buildings. Some example buidling created by Probuilder tool is placed inside this folder: Models -> Buidlings -> CreatedByProBuilder.

In order to give realistic appearance to objects and buidling surfaces, realistic material should be created.
