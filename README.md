## Explanation about the Unity project
This unity project aimed to provide a guideline for students' projects providing a virtual museum experience. At start, user finds himself/herself in front of a door.
By tapping on the screen of the smartphone (or presseing the button of the cardboard), s/he can move in the direction of his/her looking. Passing a corridor, s/he will reach to the entering of two rooms with texts and images overlayed on their surrounding walls.  The left room provides two interactions: with a video player and with an image viewer through having eye gaze on the available buttons. In the second room that presents models on top of a base, user can interact with them by rotating them by having her/his gaze on top of the rotate button placed on their tops. 

This scene is created by:

- A 3D model of a building (made by ProBuilder plugin) placed in the ModelsAssessories folder
- 3D models of the products placed in the ModelsAssessories folder
- Images for the walls placed in the Material folder
- Images to create an image viewer placed in the Material folder
- A video for the video player placed in the Video folder
- Some pannels of the information on the walls 
- C sharp scripts to make the user be able to move in the environment, rotating objects, and change the images for the image viewer placed in the Scripts folder.

## Create a simple building with probuilder Unity
** First method, using the "New Poly Shape tool":

Note: with this method the interior part of the building will be used. It is a very fast method for every plan of the buildings.

** Second method, using "New Shape tool":

Note: we have both interior and exterior of the building to work with it.
