## Explaining the Unity project

This unity project includes example assets such as models, materials, textures, videos, and scripts placed in the related folders. 

In the scenes folder of the project, double click on the name of a scene named "Virtual Museum" to open it. This example scene aimed to provide a guideline for students' projects providing a virtual museum experience. At the start, the user finds himself/herself in front of a door. By tapping on the screen of the smartphone (or pressing the button of the cardboard), s/he can move in the direction of his/her look. Passing a corridor, s/he will reach the entering of two rooms with texts and images overlayed on their surrounding walls. The left room provides two interaction experiences: with a video player and with an image viewer through having eye gaze on the available buttons. In the second room that presents models on top of a base, users can rotate them by having her/his gaze on top of the rotate button placed on their tops.
