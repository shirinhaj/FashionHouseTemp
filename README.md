## Explaining the unity project

This unity project includes some example assets such as models, materials, textures, videos, and scripts placed in the related folders that can be used for creating new projects. 

### The example scene:

In the scenes folder of the project, double click on the name of a scene named "Virtual Museum" to open it. This example scene aimed to provide a guideline for students providing a virtual museum experience. At the start the experience, the user finds himself/herself in front of a door. By tapping on the screen of the smartphone (or pressing the button of the cardboard), s/he can move in the direction of his/her look. Passing a corridor, s/he will reach the entering of two rooms with texts and images overlayed on their surrounding walls. The left room provides two interaction experiences through having eye gaze on the available buttons: a video player and an image viewer. In the right room, user can rotate 3D models of clothes by having her/his gaze on top of the rotate buttons.

### The template scene:

In the scenes folder of the project, the template scene is provide as a starting point for the projects.

## Links to the helpful tutorials
During the projects, student will need to create the experience in a virtual building with realistic appearance.


### *Virtual Building

The 3D model of building could be provided whether by downloading from the websites or creating by Probuilder tool in Unity.

#### **Find some example for 3D models of the building inside these folders: 

For downloaded models: Assets -> Models -> Buildings -> Downloaded Buildings. 

For models created by Probuilder tool: Assets -> Models -> Buidlings -> CreatedByProBuilder.



### *Realistic appearance for the 3D models

In order to give realistic appearance to objects and buidling surfaces, realistic material should be created.
